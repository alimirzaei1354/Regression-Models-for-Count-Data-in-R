#The Wald test (a.k.a. Wald Chi-Squared Test) is a parametric statistical measure to confirm whether a set of independent variables are collectively ‘significant’ for a model or not. It is also used for confirming whether each independent variable present in a model is significant or not.
#If the Wald test shows that the parameters for certain explanatory variables are zero, we can remove the variables from the model.
#If the test shows the parameters are not zero, we should include the variables in the model.
